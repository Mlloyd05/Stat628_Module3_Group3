## Module3 Group3
In this module, we focus on using data from Yelp which contains information about coffee shops across the U.S. and comments they receive from the customers to figure out what makes some coffee shops more attractive than its competitor. Based on our analysis, we establish a set of recommendations that might improve their business or at least to ratings on Yelp. Here is an subset of the data set we used.
